Stop and wait ARQ 

Done by Mr Ngema

The code use linux ubuntu 17.04 or any. To interact the transmitter and the receiver you must use port number (format: ./compiler_name port_number). The code is implemented using c language. NB:the stop and wait protocol is perfomed using two terminals for recieving and transmitting operation
& port_number must be similar inorder to exchange the data.
